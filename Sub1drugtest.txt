#! Sample PBS submission script for a MATLAB job
#! Requesting resource (processors and wall-clock time): #! nodes=1:ppn=1 indicates a single processor.
#! nodes=1:ppn=16 would request a whole node for BCp3. #! 02:30:00 indicates 02 hours and 30 minutes
#
#!this throws an error maybe it doesnt do anything?
PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1,walltime = 02:00:00
#! change the working directory (default is home directory) 
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
#! Record some useful job details in the output file echo Running on host `hostname`
echo Time is `date`
echo Directory is `pwd`
echo PBS job ID is $PBS_JOBID
echo This jobs runs on the following nodes: 
echo `cat $PBS_NODEFILE | uniq`
#! add the MATLAB module (as per BCp3) 
module add apps/matlab-r2019a
#! NB have limited MATLAB to a single thread 
options="-nodesktop -noFigureWindows -singleCompThread"
#! Run MATLAB in batch mode
